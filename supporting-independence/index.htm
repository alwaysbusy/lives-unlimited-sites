                <h2>An event with Lives Unlimited and York Independent Living Network</h2>
                <p>Many thanks to everyone who came on the 17th October to our event.  We heard from organisations around the country who offered support to people using direct payments. Almost 40 people discussed what they needed and asked questions and talked about what life is like now.</p>
                <p>Direct payments are intended to give disabled people rights as citizens and choice and control over their support so they can organise their own support and have a better quality of life as a result. To make this work effectively, people need to have access to the right amount and quality of support to manage their direct payments. This may vary from payroll to recruiting excellent PAs, PA training, helping with an employment issue and lots more.</p>
                <p>Our three speakers came from organisations that offer direct payment support in very different but creative ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Les Scaife</strong>, West Lancashire Peer Support - started as a small group of families who set up a simple system for managing direct payments. WLPS ensures that disabled people and families know their rights, for example, around pre paid cards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pippa Murray</strong>, ibk initiatives described how ibk, inspired by her son, Kim, aims to help young disabled people achieve full and meaningful lives using direct payments. ibk offer payroll, PA recruitment and supervision as well as social gatherings and activities for young disabled people and families.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lynne Turnbull</strong>, Cheshire Centre for Independent Living (CIL) has  grown into a large user led service, commissioned by the LA and NHS with which it enjoys good relationships. Cheshire CIL offers payroll and recruitment support, advocacy, youth groups, support planning, PA training and access to community activities.</li>

                <h2>Supporting Independence</h2>
                <p>The Supporting Independence event was held jointly by York Independent Living Network and Lives Unlimited (York) CiC to gather the views and comments from disabled people and their families about support needs for managing a personal budget and direct payments.</p>
                <p>Direct payments, hard won by disabled people, have been around for a long time. Rather than having ‘care’ provided by social services, direct payments were intended to give disabled people rights as citizens. As we know the idea behind direct payments and personal budgets is that people organise their own support and have a better quality of life as a result.</p>
                <p>But what does it take to make a DP or a PB translate into a good life? Many of us would say it’s having an organisation we trust who shares our values, who will do as much or as little as we ask – from payroll to recruiting excellent PAs, PA training or helping with an employment issue.</p> 
                <p>Attendees heard from three very different user and family led organisations who do just that. Importantly we wanted to hear from people about what support would make life easier for them in managing their DP/PB.</p>
                <p>As CYC are changing the way they provide support for independence under the guise of the Care Act this was a great opportunity to make our collective voices heard to help ensure we get the support each of us needs to make the most of our DP or PB.</p>
                <p>The afternoon was about thinking what we want and need rather than just choosing from someone else’s menu. And about what we as experts in our own lives may be able to share with others.</p>
                <h3>What <strong>is</strong> good support for independence?</h3>
                <img src="feedback1.jpg" alt="Les Scaife" style="float: right; max-width: 20%;" class="inline" />
                <p><strong>Les Scaife</strong> told us about West Lancashire Peer Support who began as a group of parents to set up a simple system for accounting and managing accounts. One important aspect of the organisation is making sure that people know their rights. Les told us about how people had been helped to change the imposition of Cashplus cards and how WLPS offered support as corporate appointees for people unable to manage finances themselves.</p>
                <p><strong>Pippa Murray</strong> described how IBK Initiatives had developed from ideas inspired by her son Kim. Pippa told us about the fantastic families and Personal Assistants she had been able to work with and continued to be inspired by Kim to aim for full and meaningful lives for disabled young people</p>
                <p>We talked about what support was like for us now and thought about some questions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Who manages your budget?</li>
                    <li>Who supports you with Recruitment, Training, Supervision, Payroll, Cover for sickness/holiday (others?)</li>
                    <li>Where does that support come from?</li>
                    <li>What is the best thing about your current support for PB/DP?</li>
                    <li>What would make it work better?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We found out that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most people managed their own budget or managed it on behalf of a family member, some people had help for this from ILS. In the main, family organised and ran the day to day aspects of a PB also overseeing accounting and payment tasks.
                        <blockquote>“All these tasks can overwhelm ordinary life - makes having a social or work life impossible.”</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Currently there is only ILS available to support in York and people wanted this service to continue. Sometimes, though, there was conflicting information about how people could spend their budgets from social workers and ILS.
                        <blockquote>“(Mis)information council/ILS what can the money be spent on?”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Clarity about DP vs PB - train your SW staff.” </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Lack of information in writing about how DP and PB work.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Who can advise us about what choices there are?”</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While ILS was able to offer support with recruitment, sometimes this was not enough for example people said
                        <blockquote>“ILS helps with recruitment but we still have difficulties finding people.”</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Similarly, family members provided cover for sick or annual leave for various reasons including lack of capacity, lack of availability, not wanting to bring in unknown agency staff and trying to keep costs to a minimum.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People were happy with the flexibility that PB and DP provide but there were questions and comments about enough knowledgeable  support to enable disabled people and families to continue such as 
                        <blockquote>“Positive communication with people who are meant to be supporting carers.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“How are CYC going to meet the increasing costs of services and wages for PAs?”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Communication problems re legislation and responsibilities.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“ILS may be able to provide a better service when not paid directly by CYC.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“We need SW who have a good understanding of direct payments and personal budgets.”</blockquote>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="feedback2.jpg" alt="ibk Initiatives" style="float: left; max-width: 20%;" class="inline" />
                <p><strong>Lynne Turnbull</strong> talked about the development of her organisation into the large user led service it is today. As well as the usual payroll and recruitment support, Cheshire CIL offers advocacy, youth groups, support planning, PA training and access to community activities. It is commissioned by the LA and NHS bodies with which it has a good working relationship.</p>
                <p>We asked people to think about the things they had heard from the speakers and to consider some more questions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reflecting on previous answers; can you see any gaps in your current support?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything that could make a big difference?</li>
                    <li>Which tasks would you like to pass on to another organisation/person?</li>
                    <li>Would peer support be helpful in York?</li>
                    <li>How might this work?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We found out that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Now it feels like we are being told that we can have choice and control. But because there is not a clear understanding from social care we are getting mixed and sometimes complicated messages. For example people who have complex needs or joint funding are asking questions and these take a long time to answer due to being passed around various professionals. They also involve a lot of information that is confusing and meaningless (such as how funding streams work) to disabled people who just want to get on with it. Added to this is a further complicated system of agreements and policies which aren't simple to understand. People feel like there is more and more restriction on how they can use PB.

                        <blockquote>“Promises delivered.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Stop interfering and listen to us.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Honour the independence of the budget.”</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Less talk more action.”</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There were tasks that some people would like to pass onto other people or organisations such as rota planning, activity planning, completing time sheets and information logs, formal documents such as risk assessments, maintaining medical passports etc. People were concerned that budgets had been reviewed annually but in some cases had not seen an increase to allow for incremental wage increases for PAs for a number of years. Banking hours to allow time for PAs to do research and also training would be helpful.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An independent advisor would be helpful, someone who knows the legal position for PB/DP and can help people by offering advice and information. This should be a free access service much like anyone accessing CAB etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What we need</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disabled people should not have to pay for information and advice.</li>
                    <li>We were not aware of independent advocacy service in York.</li>
                    <li>It works when support is personalised, local and clear.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="feedback5.jpg" alt="What we Need" style="width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" />

                <h2>Messages from Supporting Independence</h2>
                <h6>A joint Lives Unlimited and YILN event held on 17th October 2015 1 - 4.30 pm</h6>
                <p>The aim of the event was to gather views and comments from disabled people and families about their support needs for managing a personal budget or direct payment.</p>
                <p>Discussions between disabled people and family members at the event covered how direct payments and personal budgets currently work for people and how this could be improved. Most people managed their own budget or managed it on behalf of a family member. Some people had help with this to varying degrees from ILS.</p>
                <h3>Messages for City of York Council commissioners and managers</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Ethos of direct payments and personal budgets</h4>
                        <p>People considered themselves to be experts in their own lives and only needed support to complement this, not to replace it. One person said:</p>
                        <blockquote>“Honour the independence of the budget.”</blockquote>
                        <p>In the light of the council’s current changes to support for direct payments people were disappointed not to have been involved in discussing potential changes at an earlier stage rather than having them imposed.</p>
                        <blockquote>“Stop interfering and listen to us.”</blockquote>
                        <img src="message1.jpg" alt="Now" style="max-width: 20%; float: right;" class="inline" />
                        <p>Some people said that although they were being told they would have more choice and control over their direct payment, they frequently had mixed messages from different departments (social care and health) which could lead to confusion and delays.</p>
                        <p>People said that to avoid their lives being adversely complicated by managing their direct payment or personal budget they wanted very clear information, advice and support.</p>
                        <p>People stated that attitudes towards disabled people and family members managing their own direct payment varied between different council departments and agencies, often leading to confusion. This included attitudes towards disabled people and family members as experts and about choice and control over what a personal budget could be spent on. People felt that training staff in different departments would help prevent this confusion.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Bureaucracy and the responsibility of managing a direct payment</h4>
                        <p>For families especially, managing a substantial budget including all the day to day aspects, payroll, rotas, training and supervising teams of PAs can take over their lives:</p>
                        <blockquote>“All these tasks can overwhelm ordinary life ‐ it makes having a social or work life impossible.”</blockquote>
                        <p>Difficulties of recruiting cover for sick or annual leave means that family members have to fill any gaps in the rota which changes the nature of the relationship with their son, daughter or other family member. </p>
                        <p>People talked about having a lot of confusing, sometimes irrelevant information. There is a further complicated system of agreements and policies which are not always easy to understand. Some people felt there was a communication problem about legislation and responsibilities relating to direct payments.</p>
                        <p>The spirit of direct payments was sometimes thought to be lost and people were concerned that there should be a minimum of rules.</p>
                        <blockquote>“Don't crush flexibility and creativity by imposing (too many) rules.”</blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Support we need</h4>
                        <img src="message2.jpg" alt="What we Need" style="float: left; max-width: 30%;" class="inline" />
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Currently only ILS is available to support people with direct payments and personal budgets in York and people said they wanted this service to continue. However, while ILS offers support with recruitment, this is not always successful and people felt there were also other areas that could be improved or extended by ILS:</p>
                                <blockquote>“ILS helps with recruitment but we still have difficulties finding people.”</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>There were tasks that some people would like to pass onto other people or organisations such as rota planning, activity planning, completing time sheets and information logs, formal documents such as risk assessments, maintaining medical passports, recruiting cover PAs for PA sickness and holidays, filling gaps in the rota etc.  Will people be given enough money to do this?</li>
                            <li>One person thought that: “ILS may be able to provide a better service when (they are) not paid directly by CYC.”</li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The lack of written information can often lead to misunderstandings and misinformation. People said there was not enough clear, simple information written in clear English about direct payments. This included how to apply for a direct payment, what people could use their direct payment for, as well as agreements, terms and conditions. People felt that information from CYC about direct payments and personal budgets needs to be substantially improved.</p>
                                <blockquote>“(There is a) lack of information in writing about how direct payments and personal budgets work.”</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Organising PA support is a skilled task but many disabled people and family members are not used to being employers. Many people said that they would like an independent adviser - someone who knows the legislation and practice relating to direct payments including the Care Act. This should be a free access service much like anyone accessing Citizens Advice Bureau, for example.</p>
                                <blockquote>“Who can advise us about what choices there are?”</blockquote>
                                <p>People also wanted social workers and care managers to have an excellent understanding of direct payments and personal budgets so they could give full, high quality information about direct payments. People were not aware of independent advocacy services in York.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>In conclusion</h4>
                        <p>People at the event agreed that good support for independence was:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Personalised, local and clear</li>
                            <li>Clear written information</li>
                            <li>Independent information, advice and advocacy from specialist advisers</li>
                            <li>Being listened to</li>
                            <li>Peer support enabling disabled people and families to share their expertise and experiences</li>
                            <li>Listening to ideas and possibilities from other areas about how things can work differently; Being creative</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h3>Questions for CYC</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>How much will disabled people and families be given for direct payment support?</li>
                    <li>How will the amount be worked out?</li>
                    <li>Can CYC reassure us that the payment will be enough to buy support at least equivalent to that currently provided by ILS, bearing in mind that ILS currently benefits from economies of scale?</li>
                    <li>What information will be produced about direct payments and direct payment support in York? What proposals are there to work with disabled people and families to ensure high quality, coproduced information?</li>
                    <li>How are CYC going to meet the increasing costs of services and wages for PAs? Although budgets are reviewed annually, people were concerned that they had not received any increase in their budget to allow for incremental wage increases, often over many years. What is CYC’s position on this please? Can people bank hours to allow time for PAs to do research, training etc?</li>
